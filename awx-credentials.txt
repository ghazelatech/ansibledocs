Step 1: Generate or Obtain an SSH Key Pair
If you don’t already have an SSH key, generate one inside the AWX Task container:

* Access the AWX Task container:


> docker exec -it awx_task bash


* Generate an SSH key pair:

	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f /var/lib/awx/.ssh/ansible_awx_key -N ""
	Public key: /var/lib/awx/.ssh/ansible_awx_key.pub
	Private key: /var/lib/awx/.ssh/ansible_awx_key

Exit the container:
	exit

Step 2: Copy the SSH Key to the Remote VM

To allow AWX to SSH into the VM, copy the public key to the VM:

View the public key:

	docker exec -it awx_task cat /var/lib/awx/.ssh/ansible_awx_key.pub

Copy the key to the remote VM: On your VM, run:

	echo "<PASTE_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Test SSH from the AWX container:

	docker exec -it awx_task ssh -i /var/lib/awx/.ssh/ansible_awx_key <remote_user>@<vm_ip>


Add SSH Credentials to AWX

- Navigate to: Resources → Credentials.
- Click + Add (upper right).
- Fill in the credential details:
- Name: Remote VM SSH Credentials
- Organization: Select your organization.
- Credential Type: Machine
- Username: <remote_user> (e.g., ubuntu, centos, root)
- Private Key:
	Go back to the AWX container and run:
	docker exec -it awx_task cat /var/lib/awx/.ssh/ansible_awx_key
	
	Copy the entire private key and paste it into the Private Key field in AWX.
- Privilege Escalation Method: Select sudo if required.
- Password: Leave blank (unless using a password-based SSH login).
- Become Password: If sudo requires a password, enter it here.
- Click Save.

Add the VM to the AWX Inventory

- Go to: Resources → Inventories.
- Click + Add to create a new inventory.
- Name: Remote VM Inventory
- Organization: Select your organization.
- Click on the new inventory → Hosts tab → + Add.
- Hostname: <vm_ip> (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
- Click Save.

Step 6: Test Connection with Ansible Ping

- Go to: Resources → Templates.
- Click + Add → Job Template.
- Fill in the template details:
- Name: Ping Test
- Inventory: Select Remote VM Inventory
- Project: Select an existing project (or create a simple playbook).
- Playbook: Use ping.yml (or create a basic Ansible playbook).
- Credentials: Select Remote VM SSH Credentials.
- Click Save, then Launch the job.


Troubleshooting

❌ Permission denied (publickey)

Ensure the public key is correctly copied to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the VM.
Ensure the private key is correctly pasted in AWX.

❌ SSH timeout

Check if port 22 is open on the VM’s firewall/security group.
Ensure the VM is reachable from AWX’s Docker network (docker network inspect <network-name>).

❌ Sudo password required

Edit credentials and add the Become Password.
